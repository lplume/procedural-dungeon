Disclaimer

Im sorry to hardcore pythonist for my bad syntax,
this project is also a chance to learn this beauty better.

GOALS
===
I push only the devel branch, because this is my very very first commit,
i am gonna package sources better soon or later.

My goal is to attach a tileset image, and output:
* a png map
* a tiled tmx file
